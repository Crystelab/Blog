# Blog
This is the repo of my [website](https://crystelab.net/). I don’t update it frequently. This project was created to learn the basics of web development.

## Stack
This website is made without a frontend framework, so just JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

Express.js is used for the backend.

MongoDB is used for the database.
