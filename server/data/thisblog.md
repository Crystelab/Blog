This blog was created to document my journey as a developer. Built using the **Astro** framework, it offers a fast and flexible platform for building static sites. **TinaCMS** is integrated for easy content management, allowing me to edit and publish posts seamlessly.

The foundation of this blog is based on a template created by Cassidy, which provided a solid starting point, allowing me to focus on customization and content without worrying about the underlying structure. You can check out her original template here: [Cassidy's Blahg Template](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg).

### Why I Chose This Setup

When starting this project, I wanted a balance between ease of use and the ability to customize. Astro provided the performance and flexibility I needed, while TinaCMS allowed for an intuitive way to manage content without diving into complex backend setups. So essentially, I added a project tag and tweaked the styling to better match my taste. This setup gives me the freedom to make changes later if I feel like it.

### Future Plans

I plan to document my progress as I learn new technologies, tackle challenging projects, and refine my skills. Writing helps me retain what I learn, and I see this blog as a way to support my personal growth. Additionally, maybe someone out there will appreciate my blog the same way I've appreciated others' blogs.
