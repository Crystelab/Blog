API stands for Application Programming Interface, but that doesn’t really answer the question, does it? In fact, it probably raises more questions, like: I thought APIs were backend stuff and had nothing to do with interfaces. Is it a server? What even is a server?

From what I’m learning, an API abstracts backend stuff, letting you do things like adding routes with just a bit of code. I still can’t fully wrap my head around how the backend works, and that’s kind of the point. An API is an interface that lets you work with the backend without needing to know all the gritty details. You just need to understand what each function does. Its purpose is to make it so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

For example, Node.js is often used to create APIs. It’s built from a bunch of packages created by other developers, and you don’t need to know exactly how they work to use them, just like you dont need to know how to cook to oder at a restaurant. You can find all these packages and their commands [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).

While learning about APIs, I kept trying to understand them the same way I think about frontend development, but the whole idea of Node.js is to abstract a lot of backend complexity. Also, you can’t create APIs with just vanilla JavaScript because you need something called a runtime environment.

So, what’s a runtime environment? It’s a program that runs your code continuously. So… is that a server? I’m still figuring it out, but it seems like every time I answer one question, another one pops up!
